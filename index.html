        <p>The Global Book Nook is a space where you can travel the world from a little nook or space in your home. Books are a window to the world and complementaty food and drinks can make the book more experiential. Read a book about Italy and discuss the themes, from the book, with friends over a plate of pasta with a glass of wine. What's better than that?</p>
